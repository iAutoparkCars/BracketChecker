	>BracketChecker
		Algorithm to check if brackets () {} [] are matched using a stack. There is a test class SolutionTest.java.

		and detect cycles.
	
	>MyHeap
		written functions to insert(v), delete(v), and printMin of a heap, implemented as an array.
		Passes most unit tests.
		delete(v), which calls insert(v), is slightly buggy; not going to spend more hours trying
